# Receipt Processor

This Go application processes receipts and calculates points based on specific rules. The application exposes endpoints to add receipts and retrieve points for a specific receipt.

## Endpoint: Process Receipts

- `POST`: `/receipts/process`: Takes in a JSON receipt as payload and returns a JSON object with an ID generated.
- `GET `: `/receipts/{id}/points`: Adds a new receipt and returns a unique ID.
- `GET `: `/receipts`: Lists all receipts.

## Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

- One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
- 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
- 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
- 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
- If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
- 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
- 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.
